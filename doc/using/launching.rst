The primary way of launching 3ds Max with the ftrack integration is to download and
use the
:ref:`ftrack Connect package <using/installing_ftrack_connect_package>`.

Once installed and running you can start 3ds Max from the Actions tab after
browsing to a task.

.. note::

    If the ftrack integration fails to load with a DLL import error when using
    3ds Max 2016, please install Microsoft's Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable.
